## About
Our project wants to take our existing gSense solution, that is already helping a huge number of patients to overcome health problems, to have another level of security of their health data.

With zencon blockchain the data will be stored, only when allowed for the patient and as access is granted and saved in a timeline on zeniq smartchain, this will bring for the client the best that transparency can offer.

Our contract is OpenSource, secure, giving the user the knowledge that all the records and reports that are stored in zeniq blockchain are only "growth-lead". The users records can grow but the ability to change older records don't exist.

## How?

Our Plugin to NomoAPP will give a lower barrier for users to get integrated with the blockchain, as we make sure that they're using a secure contract, where they have all the knowledge and access to their data.

patients communicate by adding and revoking access to their current record state to medics, where this knowledge is recorded by the Zeniq Smartchain bring the next level security for both parties.

By Nutrix Team, to you, to everyone.
