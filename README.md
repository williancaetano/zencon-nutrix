## About
Our project wants to take our existing gSense solution, that is already helping a huge number of patients to overcome health problems, to have another level of security of their health data.

With zencon blockchain the data will be stored, only when allowed for the patient and as access is granted and saved in a timeline on zeniq smartchain, this will bring for the client the best that transparency can offer.

Our contract is OpenSource, secure, giving the user the knowledge that all the records and reports that are stored in zeniq blockchain are only "growth-lead". The users records can grow but the ability to change older records don't exist.
